# Hello!

I'm excited to ask you to create a task management page with a more polished feel, using only HTML and CSS. I would like a modern and functional look. Here are the full details of what I have in mind:

Header:

     A stylish header with a gradient background that ranges from a dark blue (#007BFF) at the top to a lighter shade at the bottom.
     The header must be fixed at the top of the page, even when the page is scrolled.
     Center the "My To-Do List" text in the header.
     Apply a bold font to make the title more prominent.

Body:

     A centered container with a maximum width of 800px and inner margins of 2em.
     Add a soft shadow to the container to create a sense of elevation.

Task Add Form:

     A more refined task entry form.
     The text entry field should have a smooth border and light inner shading.
     A rounded, stylized button with background color #007BFF and white text should accompany the input field.
     The font used in the input field must be different from the header font to distinguish the elements.

Task List:

     A well-organized and visually appealing to-do list.
     Use a list style with no bullets and spacing between items.
     Each task must include a checkbox icon on the left and a text label on the right.
     When hovering over a task, the background should lighten slightly to indicate interactivity.

Task Tags:

     Use custom checkbox icons (for example, an empty circle) to indicate uncompleted tasks.
     When a task is complete, apply a style to display a checkmark icon inside the circle.

Delete Finished Button:

     A button below the task list to remove tasks marked as completed.
     Style the button with a red background color (#FF4136) and white text.

General Style:

     Use a legible font for body text, such as "Helvetica Neue" or Arial.
     Apply a white background to the page to ensure comfortable reading.
     Maintain a cohesive color palette to create a harmonious visual experience.
